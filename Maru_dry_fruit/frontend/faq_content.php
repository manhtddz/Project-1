        <p class="question">Q. Are there any allergen considerations for your products?</p>
        <p class="answer">A. We package our products in the same facility as peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, soy, and
            milk products. <br>
            Though our facility is not a certified allergen-free facility, we try our best to prevent
            cross-contamination
            through specific processes like sanitizing each station before packing a new item there and separating
            lanes and equipment for peanuts, tree nuts and gluten-free items.</p><br>

        <p class="question">Q. How do I change my shipping information?</p>
        <p class="answer">A. Go to the My Next Shipment tab on the the Track Order page and select Edit in the
            "Shipping Info"
            section.</p><br>

        <p class="question">Q. What is the average shelf life for my products?</p>
        <p class="answer">A. Nuts should be stored in a cool, dry environment. All of ours nuts are good for up to
            6-9 months. Dried
            fruit should be stored in a cool environment (refrigerator) and can also last 6-9 months. </p><br>

        <p class="question">Q. How can I place an order?</p>
        <p class="answer">A. You are more than welcome to place your order through the Maru dry fruits website by
            adding products to your
            cart and clicking on "Check Out" once you are ready. </p><br>
        <p class="question">Q. What if I don not like the product?</p>
        <p class="answer">A. In the unlikely event that you do not like our product, we promise to take them back
            and
            reimburse the product cost. </p>
